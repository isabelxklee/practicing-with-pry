## Notes
1. Start with an empty method. Declare an array outside of the method. Invoke the function and call binding.pry.
2. Call binding.pry inside of the method and see what it returns.
3. Write a loop inside the method. Call binding.pry inside the loop. Write the code block inside pry. Copy and paste it into the file afterwards.
